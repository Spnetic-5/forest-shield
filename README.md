# Forest-Shield

We propose a smart assistive technology named Forest Shield which assists or prevents Forest Fires from spreading in the particular area by using the technology of Image Processing algorithms and smoke detection. This system is designed on raspberry pi keeping the scalability of the system in mind. It also provides the location and instant alert through sending email to the assigned forest officials along with the precise location link and a Siren alert in the area when the smoke and fire is detected in the forest.
